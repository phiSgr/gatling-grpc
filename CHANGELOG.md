#### 0.14.0

Gatling 3.8.3.

Allows accessing the status of streaming calls.

Streaming method descriptors are moved earlier in the construction,
provided at the same time as `streamName`.
This change makes it harder to have type errors.

Various changes to make Kotlin/Java access easier.

#### 0.13.0

Gatling 3.7.6.
- `checkIf` (and `endCheckIf` for streams) implemented.

Reduce verbose logs to DEBUG
following [Gatling 3.6.0](https://github.com/gatling/gatling/commit/4daad7)

Bugfix: `trailer.find(n)` was always returning the first element.

Server/bidi stream end logging:
- `streamEndLog(logWhen)` added.
- the start/end in the report is now the duration of the call,
instead of the empty interval at the end of the call.

#### 0.12.0

Gatling 3.6.1. ScalaPB 0.11.6.

Allows the virtual user to wait for the (server/bidi) stream to end
or for a new message to come,
blocking the flow of that virtual user.

Headers can be now specified in the `Protocol` level.

#### 0.11.1
Bugfix: `halfClose` was not called on client stream complete.

#### 0.11.0
Scala 2.13. Gatling 3.5.0.

Following the convention of Gatling, since there is no cross-build,
the suffix `_2.xx` is removed.
Remember to change the `%%` to `%` in your dependency.

#### 0.10.1
`DynamicGrpcProtocol.disposeChannel` for closing the dynamic channel early.

#### 0.10.0
CHANGE OF BEHAVIOUR: the timestamp extractor is run **BEFORE**
the checks are run. This makes it easier to detect "first" messages in a stream.

Improves streaming logging, mimics Gatling WebSocket wordings.

Lazy parsing for streaming calls.

Dynamic Channel support. Remember to `exec`
`dyanmicConf.setChannel` before running `.target(dyanmicConf)`.

Uses the `EventLoopGroup` of Gatling in the `ManagedChannel`s.

Client streaming which measures time between client half close
and server completion.

Moved some code to [Gatling-Ext](https://github.com/phiSgr/gatling-ext).
- `SessionCombiner` is now `com.github.phisgr.gatling.generic.SessionCombiner`.
- `extract` and `extractMultiple` now expect a function that returns a `Validation`.
This is mostly source-compatible because of the automatic implicit conversion to
a successful validation, `import`ed from `io.gatling.core.Predef`.

#### 0.9.0
Upgrades to Gatling 3.4.0.

Defaults to not parsing gRPC response for unary calls.
Call `forceParsing` on your GrpcProtocol to force parsing.

Removed the `.exists(f)` check shorthand.
Write `.extract(f)(_.exists)` instead.

Streaming support!

#### 0.8.2
Fix metadata reflection failure.
Supports silent and group.

#### 0.8.1
Added methods named `managedChannelBuilder`. They mean the same as
`ManagedChannelBuilder.forTarget` or `ManagedChannelBuilder.forAddress`
but have a return type that is easier for the type inference of IntelliJ.
In addition, since Gatling-gRPC does not block threads,
they use the `directExecutor` by default to further improve performance.

#### 0.8.0
This release contains structural changes
that are a step closer to supporting streaming APIs.
Most notably the function-taking API,
that allows arbitrary Scala code to be run, is gone.

As things got moved around, you may need to check your imports.

New functionalities:
- Warm up call to force the class-loading. By default the call is a
[health check](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/proto/grpc/health/v1/health.proto).
- Specification of call options.
- Trailer extraction.
- Improved logging.

Improved performance:
- Use while loop to implement `foldM`-like manipulation.
  - Performance of dynamic payload creation with ScalaPB lenses
  is now comparable to using [Gatling-JavaPB](java-pb).
- Removed the use of futures in `GrpcCallAction`.

#### 0.7.0
Logs failed requests with a non-OK status code.
Adds `Expression` versions of Lens extension methods.
Upgrades versions.

#### 0.6.0
Adds `target` for connections to different endpoints
different from the value specified in `protocols`.
Upgrades to Gatling 3.3.0.

#### 0.5.0
Upgrades to Gatling 3.2.0.
Fixed the duplicated "extraction crashed" in error messages.

#### 0.4.1
The `Expression`s created with `updateExpr` should be faster.

#### 0.4.0
Uses the `RequestAction`,
if you have unbuildable requests in your tests,
you will get more error logs.

#### 0.3.0
Throttling support and channel sharing,
removed `setUpGrpc` as it is done automatically.

#### 0.2.0
Migrated to Gatling 3.0.
The new version should be source compatible with the previous one,
as evidenced by the test which is not changed.

#### 0.1.0
Previously method references
(functions that are not applied, an `_` before a method)
were used to refer to an RPC.
In this version, method descriptors are used,
bringing a better looking API.
But the old one is still kept for more flexibility.
